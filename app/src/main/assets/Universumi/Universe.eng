<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Preface<br>
</span></h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">When watching starry sky at the
night, numerous twinkling stars and that enormity, what the heavenly
cover offers for everyone to see, one surely convince himself how small
people are compared to the huge or actually infinite size of the
universe. But, althouhg the universe is enormous big space, is the
universe or cosmos really infinite? And what means that universe would
be infinite? And, on the other hand, what means if universe would be
finite?<br>
<br>
As a good starting point many of us probably assume that if we had a
spaceship, which is able to travel in space forever and is also able to
keep its direction so that it would fly straight line though the space,
the
spaceship would be able to move forever in some direction (of course we
need to suppose, that it won't crash with some planet or something).
People who think this way may also think, that the space <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> be infinite, because if it's
not infinite, the spaceship cannot move forever in some direction but
the travel will be prevented one way or another. But this is not the
case: The alternative to the infinite space need not to be limited
(notice I said <span style="font-style: italic;">limited</span>, not <span style="font-style: italic;">finite</span>) like the video game fields
are, for example in figure 1.
<table style="text-align: left; float: right; width: 30%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img style="width: 100%;" alt="" src="StarWars.jpg"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><small style="font-style: italic;">Fig. 1. A view from Star

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
Finite space need not to be aviary or
aquarium, but the universe can be both unlimited and finite (someone
would say <span style="font-style: italic;">borderless</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">without boundaries</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">without edges</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">unlimited</span>, but let's use a word
unlimited in this text). If the space is finite, a spaceship moving
forever straight in some direction will eventually arrive to its
starting point
just like an aircraft flying straight around the Earth. Consequently, a
single
choice between infinite and finite is not enough to define the
universe, but the universe also needs to be unlimited or limited. These
two choices are the foundation to solve the structure of the universe
as I will demonstrate in this text. If mankind wants to know, where
they are living and what they are, mankind needs to know right ansvers
to these two choices.<br>
<br>
But what is a straight line? Question is important, because the
spaceship needs to travel along a straight line to find out whether the
space is infinite or finite. In a real life, straight line is a rope
hanging with a weight. In mathematics a staight line is defined as a
shortest possible route between two points. In physics it is usually
defined - although not always, at least not in optics nor relativity
theory - that light moves through a straight line. But light itself is
defined in physics so that it will always travel a voyage between two
points through a shortest possible route. A spaceship probably keeps
its direction like light, but the shortest possible route is not
necessarily a straight line! In order to keep the shortest possible
route and the straight line equal in space, the material in space needs
to be equally spread everywhere, in practice it needs to be gas. But
that's all I'm going to discuss about the navigation problems of space
traveling.<br>
<br>
These two choices, infinite / finite and unlimited / limited, give four
choices as the basis of the structure of the universe. Part of them can
easily be treated as impossible choices, but not all of them. Let's get
acquainted with each of the four choices:<br>
