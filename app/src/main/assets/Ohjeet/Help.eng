<h1 style="text-align: center;">Instructions of Tasavalta
application for Android </h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Welcome
to your stay with
Tasavalta-application! This application could
be described as a hybrid of an electronic book, a web browser and 3D
virtual engine. It&nbsp;serves you stories, knowledge and thoughts
you hardly find anywhere else. The information served by
Tasavalta-application is meant to be taken seriously as a proposal how
to improve living conditions of humankind and to secure the continuity
of life on earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Tasavalta is an offline
application: this does not send or receive any
data on web. All data, what Tasavalta uses, is installed to your device
with an application package. Tasavalta won't use any other data than
the original application package delivered. If someone has edited or
changed original files, those files have different checksums and
Tasavalta won't open them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Tasavalta for Android has three main views. First is Main menu, where
you open files for CAD- and textview and also manage bookmarks, where
you can save to memory present CAD- and textviews so you can easily be
back to them:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<center><img style="width: 30%;" alt="" src="MainMenuPysty.jpg"></center>
<br>
The user interface of Tasavalta is in English, but the contents of
&nbsp;textview are available both in English and in Finnish and a
choice can be made in Main menu button ENGLISH/FINNISH. There are also
two other main views, namely CAD-view on the left and textview on the
right, below:<br>
<br>
<center>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 70%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 50%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><img style="width: 80%;" alt="" src="CADPysty.jpg"></td>
<td style="width: 50%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><img style="width: 80%;" alt="" src="TextPysty.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
</center>
<br>
Both CAD- and textview have view history implemented: FORWARD and BACK
buttons are in use when several files have been opened one after one.
For example, touching a BACK button of a CAD-view on the left above the
3D model changes something else which was shown earlier. The size of
history is unlimited for textview, but CAD-view is able to rememder
only three previous vies. If you open more, the oldest one ceases to
exist.<br>
<br>
The LISTING button of CAD-view reveales a menu where perspective view
or orthogonal X-, Y- or Z-view can be chosen. That menu also lists all
the parts making the 3D model on the view and every part can be
individually hide and show. If the 3D model is dynamic &#8211; meaning it has
movements &#8211; you can touch PLAY button. <br>
<br>
The PARAGRAPHS button of textview reveales another menu where you see
all the paragraphs of the current text. By touching a paragraph on a
menu textview moves to that position .<br>
<br>
If you flip your device, Tasavalta-application shows two views side by
side:<br>
<br>

</div>
<br>
<h2>First time:</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">When you launch
Tasavalta first time, as you have already done, because
you're reading this, the graphics of Tasavalta is simple: the pictures
of textview are 16 bit and CAD-view does not have dynamic lightning. If
your device is capable enough, Tasavalta is able to show elaborate
graphics and you see 24 bit pictures and dynamic lightning. However,
this requires that you close Tasavalta by touching "Close program" at
actionbar menu. After that you should launch Tasavalta again and you
see elaborate graphics if that is possible.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At first time you have quite many stories and 3D models to choose to
view on Main menu. But there's only a fraction of all the material that
Tasavalta contains! To discover hidden material you need to touch links
found on texts and 3D models and new text- and CAD-views will be shown
to you. As you open hidden material, a new button will emerge on Main
menu when restarting Tasavalta. Then you can open those views directly
from Main menu.
</div>
<br>
<h2>Touch gestures:</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There aren't anything
special with touch gestures of Main menu and
textview: they both work with one finger and the only means are either
to scroll the view vertically and horizontally or to touch a button or
a link. Operation is similar than to operate a web brobser of a smart
phone, mutta there is such a difference that you cannot zoom the
textview of Tasavalta.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On the other hand CAD-view has one, two and three finger touch gestures:<br>
<ul>
<li>To slide one finger on the screen you can rotate the
viewpoint if &nbsp;you're looking at perspective view and if the
view is orthogonal, viewpoint moves on xy-plane. Moreover, if you touch
a 3D model with one finger, the color of the model changes to white (or
red, if the color already is white) in a case when 3D model has a link.</li>
<li>To spread two fingers on the screen you can move forward if
you're looking at perspective view and if the view is orthogonal,
you're zooming in. Respectively, pinching two fingers move bacward or
zoom out. Moreover, if you want to open a link of a 3d model, which is
already white (or red) with one finger, by tapping a screen with second
finger opens a menu, where are listed all the links belonging to the 3D
model. If you tap some link on the list that link gets opened.</li>
<li>To slide three finger on the screen vertically the
viewpoint is on elevator, if you're looking at perspactive view: the
viewpoint raises or lowers parallel to y-axis.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<h2>The quality of graphics:</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">You need an efficient
device if you're using elaborate graphics, so if
Tasavalta responds with a lag, you may want to use simple graphics. You
can do this by tapping &nbsp;USE ELABORATE GRAPHICS/USE SIMPLE
GRAPHIS button, but the tap is effective only, if you don't have an
open CAD-view. If you already have an open CAD-view, you need to
restart Tasavalta before you can change the quality of graphics.
Unfortunately there is a bug on elaborate graphics: when opening a
first CAD-view with an elaborate graphics, Tasavalta may crash, and the
application closes itself. If this happens, restart Tasavalta and
reopen CAD-view with elaborate graphics. Sometimes you need to do this
several times, but when you get the first view open, opening new views
won't crash application anymore.
</div>
<br>
<h2>Using bookmarks:</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Tasavaltaa selaillessasi
saatat haluta palata myöhemmin, samalla tai
jollain toisella Tasavallan käyttökerralla, johonkin tekstinkohtaan tai
jonkin CAD mallin sijaintiin on ollut sen verran työlästä siirtyä, että
haluat seuraavalla kerralla siirtyä sinne suoraan. Tällaisia tarpeita
varten voit tallentaa enintään yhdeksän kirjanmerkkiä, jotka säilyvät
tallessa suljettuasi Tasavallan. Kirjanmerkkiin tallentuu kirjanmerkin
luontihetkellä aktiivisina olevat CAD- ja/tai tekstinäkymä (aktiivisuus
ei tarkoita näkyvillä olemista, vaan että kyseinen näkymä on viimeinen
avattuna oleva CAD- tai tekstinäkymä). Jos tallennat enemmän kuin
yhdeksän kirjanmerkkiä, vanhin kirjanmerkki häviää. Jos olemassa olevat
kirjanmerkit ovat tulleet tarpeettomiksi ja haluat tallentaa uusia
alken ensimmäisestä kirjanmerkistä, voit hävittää kaikki olemassaolevat
kirjnamerkit Main menun DELETE BOOKMARKS napista.

<br>
<h2>Printing:</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Both textview and CAD-view have printing capabilities by options "Print
text" and "Print CAD" of action bar menu. When printing a CAD-view you
get a standard size jpg file whose width is 1748 pixels and height 1240
pixels. When printing a text view you get a pdf document, which
contains the whole html document shown on textview divided into needed
amount of A4 sheets. The name of the jpg file is the name of 3D model
with added running number, and it's location is:<br>
<br>
data/com.mannonen.tasavalta/files/images/<br>
<br>
The name of the pdf file is the title of textview and it's location is:<br>
<br>
data/com.mannonen.tasavalta/files/pdfs/<br>
<br>
It is difficult to get those files from their locations, and that's why
Tasavalta will always suggests you to attach the printed file to an
email attachment. You should also notify that printed files will fill
up the memory of your device unless you close the
Tasavalta-application: Tasavalta always destroys all printed files at
locations above when closing. It is a good practice to always close
Tasavalta after heavy printing, because the size of&nbsp;a single
pdf file may be hundreds of megabytes.<br>
