<h1 style="text-align: center;">Ideal Construction<br>
</h1>

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Preface<br>
</span></h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Whether it is a machine, vehicle,
building, bridge or any human made object, it must withstand stress and
strain caused by usage: the object must be built by a suitable material
and designed correctly. But even after this we're left with a question
how much material is needed or what material thickness is needed so
that the object will last in use? This question is subject to <span style="font-style: italic;">strength of materials</span> and it is
important, because materials are not free and the less material is
needed, the more space is left for utilization. Think about a house,
whose walls are one meter thick and another house, whose walls are 10
centimeters thick. Which one has bigger rooms?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In this text we are focusing building construction and specially wood
construction, although in principle the theory to be presented, <span style="font-style: italic;">ideal construction</span>, is applicable
to any material. Wood is a perfect material to build living houses, for
example, but present 2010's production methods raises two obstacles to
prevent large-scale building use of wood:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Wood is an expensive construction material.
Furthermore, the forest resources of the Earth decreases all the time
and the forests left are needed to preserve present ecosystems alive
and to produce the oxygen we all need to breathe.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In order to use present construction methods to build spans
required by ideal construction from wood, we had to use extremely
massive wooden bars, which are both expensive and also they would fill
the space, which is meant for utilization. And furtehrmore, the
carrying capasity of the structure would be low because of massive
wooden balks need to carry their own heavy mass.</li>
</ul>
To use wood as construction material in an environmentally sustainable
way, wood on the market must be goods grown in nursery stock, not wood
of wild. In this case the adequancy and low price of wood can be
guaranteed only if there are several reasons for cultivation of trees,
like using <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tree as an energy
source</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">town
planning</span> and of course the relatively low need for wood, for
which we need the ideal construction. The reader may wonder how to
consume wood for several means would increase the adequancy of wood:
the final answer is found that the existence of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">republic</span> requires
afforestation of the whole country. Besides, novadays only the bole of
a tree is recovered, but springs, leaves, crust and the rootstock are
abandoned, although they are excellent material for energy production
as are also sawdust and wastewood from wood industry. But let's get to
the heart of the matter so how can we radically reduce the need for
construction wood or any construction material?<br>

<h2 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Basics of Stength
Theory<br>
</h2>

Any solid body, which is burdened somehow, experiences <span style="font-style: italic;">stress</span>. According to the basics of
the strength theory stress is divided into <span style="font-style: italic;">normal-</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">shear stress</span>, which are introduced
in figures 1 and 2 and also formulas 1 and 2:<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">We don't use the formulas 1 and 2 in
this text, they are shown only to help the reader to link this text to
the strength of materials in his/her mind. However, it is important to
know, that almost all materials have significantly better endurance
against normal stress (i.e. pulling or pressing) than against shear or
bending stress. But wood is an exceptional material in the sense that
its flexural strength and tensile strength are usually up to two times
bigger than compressive strength while shear strength is only one tenth
compared to the tensile strength (this is the case along the grain of
wood, but not across the grain). I'm going to concentrate on
compressive strength in this text, because the idea of the ideal
construction is to transform all shear stress to compression. Wood has
significant compressive strength along the grain reaching the same
level than concrete: the compressive strength of wood varies from
species to species between 40 - 100 MPa while the typical compressive
strength of concrete is between 30 - 80 MPa and some fiber reinforced
special concretes are between 150 - 250 MPa.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">A construction is called as an ideal
construction, if it experiences purely and only compression or tension.
For example the aqueduct in figure 3 experiences only compression. This
is possible by building arch vaults, but the problems of an arch vault
are it takes space, it is difficult to build and it is primitive as a
whole. If we compare it to the parking garage of figure 4, we can
notice, that a straight vault gives both more space and savings on
material costs, albeit that parking garage is not an ideal
construction: there's both normal and shear stresses existing. But is
possible to build a building like the parking garage of figure 4 such a
way it wold be an ideal consturction? The answer is that by using
stressed tendons mainly yes, but the details shown by the figure 4
makes the complete ideal construction impossible: shear stresses
experienced by concrete cannot be avoided. But this text introduces an
example of an <a href="C#Frame_of_Sampo">ideal construction</a>, which has straight vaults and whose material and space consumption is as effective as is on the parking garage in figure 4.<br>
