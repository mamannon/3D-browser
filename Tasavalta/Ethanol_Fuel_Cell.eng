<h1 style="text-align: center;">Ethanol Fuel Cell<br>
</h1>

<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Preface<br>
</span></h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Ethanol or ethyl alcohol or popularly liquor, a liquid people have drunk to get drunk through the history, has been chosen as the only liquid fuel in the text <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There ain't no World without Fuel</span>.
Cars, households and local generation of electrity are powered by it:
the primary use of ethanol is the generation of electricity. Cars don't
burn ethanol by combustion engines, but they are electric cars and they
produce the electricity they need by ethanol generator, for example by <a href="C#Ethanol_Generator">this one</a>. The concept is great, but the <span style="font-style: italic;">ethanol fuel cell</span> is missing.&nbsp; I'll introduce it next.<br>

<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Chemistry of Ethanol Combustion<br>
</span></h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">A device, which changes chemical energy into electric energy, is called as <span style="font-style: italic;">galvanic cell</span>. A device, which changes electric energy into chemical energy, is called as <span style="font-style: italic;">electrolytic cell</span>.
Galvanic cell produces electric power and electrolytic cell consumes
it. Galvanic cell does combustion and electrolytic cell does the
reverse reaction of combustion, so this text is a story about the
galvanic cell.<br>

<h3>Galvanic cell<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Ethanol catch fire with a match if it
is refined enough. For example, wine has usually about 15% ethanol and
the rest is mainly water, and this mixture does not ignite. In this
text ethanol is supposed to be pure, refined 95% sprii, where the rest
5% is water. The thermal value of ethanol is 26.9 MJ/kg, whereas it is
43.5 MJ/kg and 11-13 MJ/kg for gasoline and wood, respectively. When
ethanol combusts with oxygen they will change into water and carbon
dioxide as shown in reaction equation 1;<br>

<br>In equation 1 ethanol combusts perfectly, leaving no residue, no
ash, as is the case practically always, when ethanol is burned in a
proper burner. Then the ethanol will release heat 26.9 megajoules per
kilogram. But we don't want that a combustion of ethanol produces heat,
we want electric current. According to the thermal value of ethanol,
the combustion of ethanol produces 8.03 kWh/kg electric power and we
would like to get it as losslessly as possible to our use as an
electric current. Therefore the combustion of ethanol must happen
electrochemically in a cell, where ethanol doesn't combust with flame.
Let's study the combustion process by dividing the reaction 1 into
half-reactions 2 and 3:<br>
