Tässä on standardia leipätekstiä koko rivin mitalta. In 1928 Hitler
began his attempt to build the power of the party by democratic means.
In the 1928 election the Nazi Party received just under 3 per cent of
the vote, but during the campaign it had gathered a strong base. In
1929 a new settlement of the war reparations question, the Young Plan,
was adopted, opening up the possibility of an early end to the
remaining foreign occupation of a portion of Germany. Such an event
might stabilize the republic, and in fear of this, the republic&#8217;s
opponents organized a national initiative against the plan. This
initiative, which was financed by the German nationalist Alfred
Hugenberg, provided Hitler with opportunities to speak throughout
Germany. The initiative to stop the Young Plan failed, but Hitler had
recruited new followers who not only believed his message but were also
willing to finance the Nazi Party.

In late 1929 the first effects of the worldwide economic depression
(see Great Depression) were felt in Germany. The last government of the
Weimar Republic based on a majority in the Reichstag (the German
parliament) was not able to cope with the crisis and fell in March
1930. President Paul von Hindenburg appointed a new government led by
Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. However, Brüning and the Reichstag
could not agree on how to resolve the crisis. Hindenburg dissolved the
legislature and operated the government by emergency decree, rather
than through the normal legislative procedure. In new elections held
that September, the Nazis scored a great electoral breakthrough,
increasing their representation in the Reichstag from 12 to 107.
The victory of the Nazi Party, which had campaigned vigorously for the
repudiation of all of Germany's financial obligations, caused foreign
investors to withdraw their money from Germany, and the German banking
system collapsed due to lack of capital. As economic conditions
worsened, the appeal of the Nazis was far more effective than that of
other parties: the Nazis were the one group that claimed to have all
the answers. In a short time, the other political parties lost voters
to the Nazis. Unemployment rose dramatically, and in this time of great
economic hardship many who had never voted before were drawn to the

country&#8217;s problems and was not tied to one class
or interest group.
Consequently, many believed the party could establish a government that
would be more effective than the republic. In elections held in 1932,
the Nazis received more votes than any other party, and Hitler demanded
that President Hindenburg appoint him chancellor.

the Caribbean Sea, lying south-east of Cuba and west of Puerto Rico.
The second-largest island of the Caribbean after Cuba, Hispaniola has
an area of 76,200 sq km (29,420 sq mi); its greatest length is about
650 km (400 mi), and its greatest width 241 km (150 mi). Politically,
Hispaniola is divided into the separate countries of Haiti, which
occupies the western third of the island, and the Dominican Republic.
It was named La Isla Española by Christopher Columbus, who landed on
the island during his first voyage in 1492. The relief of the island is
varied, mostly consisting of alternating parallel mountain ranges and
plains. The Cordillera Central rises (in the Dominican Republic) to
10,417 ft (3,175 m) on Pico Duarte, the highest altitude in the
Caribbean. By contrast, the surface of Lago Enriquillo (also in the
Dominican Republic) is 45 m (150 ft) below sea level. The principal
rivers of the island include the Artibonite, the Camú, and the Yaque
del Nort (the longest, at 202 km/125 mi). The coastline is deeply
indented, yet has few deep-water harbours. The chief crops grown
include cacao (on the plains) and coffee (in the highlands). The
formerly densely forested highlands have begun to be heavily eroded
after deforestation caused by intensive subsistence agriculture. Cotton
and sugar cane are also produced, mainly on the southern plains. The
original inhabitants of Hispaniola were Native Americans of the Arawak
group. They eventually became extinct as a result of exploitation by
the early Spanish colonists. Black African slaves were later imported
to take the place of the Native American labourers. In 1697, by the
Peace of Ryswick, a portion of Hispaniola was formally ceded to France
and became known as Saint-Domingue. The remaining Spanish section was
called Santo Domingo. In 1795, Spain relinquished Santo Domingo to
France. General Jean Jacques Dessalines expelled the French in 1804 and
proclaimed the independence of the island, which was renamed Haiti. In
1822 Santo Domingo, which had come under Spanish rule again in 1808,
was reunited with the rest of the island. In 1844 Santo Domingo once
more declared its independence, forming the Dominican Republic, and the
island, as a geographic unit, assumed its former name, Hispaniola.

from 768 to 814, Charlemagne expanded the Frankish kingdom until it
encompassed almost all of Western Europe. Still, it is uncertain that
he would have assumed the title of Roman emperor were it not for the
support and urging of Pope Leo III. Leo sought an alliance with the
Frankish kingdom because of its power, its extent, and most of all its
devout Christianity. For these reasons, he believed it was fitted to
become the guardian of Rome and the papacy in place of the weakened
Byzantine Empire.

The pope thus broke the ties with Constantinople and
created a new Western Empire by crowning Charlemagne emperor of the
Romans on Christmas Day, 800. The new title did not confer any new
powers on Charlemagne, but it did legitimize his rule over central
Italy, a fact eventually acknowledged by the Byzantine emperor Michael
I in 812. Though not yet known as such, the Holy Roman Empire thus came
into being. Scholars continue to debate the significance of Leo&#8217;s act
for both the papacy and the Western Empire. Leo and his successors
definitely benefited from gaining temporal authority over central
Italy, in the region known as the Papal States. The coronation also
symbolically promoted both the papacy and the Frankish kings to a level
of authority comparable only to that of the Byzantine emperor. The
pope&#8217;s endorsement of Charlemagne&#8217;s rule, however, had not been sought
by the Frankish king. Charlemagne intended to have his heir crowned
without papal participation. When Leo&#8217;s successor seized an opportunity
to continue the tradition by crowning Charlemagne&#8217;s son Louis I in 817,
the precedent of papal coronation was established. By granting the
title of emperor, the papacy gained a huge influence over all
subsequent imperial candidates, ensuring the pope&#8217;s role in
legitimizing western emperors for centuries to come. Even bitter
conflicts between the popes and the emperors could not dissolve this
important ceremony. Charlemagne&#8217;s empire (called Carolingian after
Charlemagne&#8217;s Latin name, Carolus Magnus, or Charles the Great) assumed
many of the traditions and social distinctions of the late Roman
Empire, but also introduced some key governmental innovations.
Charlemagne granted large landholdings, called fiefs, to many tribal
military leaders, known as dukes, and appointed numerous Frankish
officials to the lesser posts of counts and margraves. Under
Charlemagne&#8217;s system, the dukes were kings in miniature, with all the
administrative, military, and judicial authority of the emperor within
their territories. To oversee these people, Charlemagne established a
system of travelling inspectors and representatives of the king, who
were known as missi dominici. However, Charlemagne was unable to
assimilate many of the tribal leaders fully into the new empire, and as
Charlemagne&#8217;s successors discovered, these leaders often placed their
personal interests first. Towards the end of Charlemagne's reign, the
empire had already stopped expanding and had adopted a defensive
posture. It was too large to administer effectively and consequently it
was prey to tribal dissension. The Carolingian Empire did not long
survive Charlemagne&#8217;s death in 814. It was the creation of one man
whose military strength and religious devotion alone held the realm
together. After his death, the diverging personal interests of the
Frankish nobles and the Church proved too much for his successors to
handle. Charlemagne&#8217;s successor, his son Louis I, could not prevent the
dukes and counts from transforming their feudal fiefs into hereditary
estates. The five major tribal fiefs were transformed into stem (most
likely from the German word stämme, meaning &#8220;tribal&#8221;)
duchies&#8212;Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Lorraine&#8212;and these
became the strongest in the empire, threatening the overall authority
of the emperor. Civil wars between Louis&#8217;s sons and these powerful
rulers soon disrupted imperial unity, and upon Louis&#8217;s death the empire
was divided. Microsoft ® Encarta ® Encyclopedia 2005 © 1993-2004
