p&auml;&auml;lle tai alle tai ylle.An ancient trading centre, the city of Aden was under Egyptian control from the 3rd century bc until it became a Roman colony in 24 bc. It fell successively under Ethiopian and Persian control and became associated with Yemen about the 7th century ad. It fell to the Turks in 1538 and was incorporated into the sultanate of Lahej in 1728. After British forces seized Aden in 1839, it was administered as part of India. In 1937 it became a Crown Colony, encompassing the environs and the Kuria Muria and Perim islands. Aden was declared a free port in 1850, and coastal areas were annexed to the port in 1881 and 1888. During World War II the colony of Aden was an important Allied air base.
In 1956 tension arose between Yemen (later the Yemen Arab Republic) and Great Britain over the Aden Protectorates territory. Trade union and nationalist elements in the colony generally sided with Yemen, and strikes and riots resulted from British efforts to deal with border clashes by force. These groups also opposed a plan, announced by the British government on August 20, 1962, to merge the colony with the Federation of South Arabia, but the merger was effected in January 1963. In later <img style="width: 80%; float: right;" alt="koe2" src="JPGkuva.jpg">years Aden was the focus of terrorist attacks by Arab nationalists attempting to expel the British from South Arabia. When the federation gained its independence on November 30, 1967, Aden became the capital of the new state, known from 1970 to 1990 as the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), which merged with the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) on May 22, 1990, to form the new Republic of Yemen. In April 1994 civil war broke out between the northern-based YAR and the southern-based PDRY. The war was effectivelyconcluded in July when the YAR besieged and captured Aden, by which time much of the city’s infrastructure had been heavily damaged.
